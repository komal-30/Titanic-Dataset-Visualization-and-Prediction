# Titanic-Dataset-Visualization-and-Prediction
*Introduction:*
As it is already known about the famous ship Titanic and the hazardous incident that
happened with it.The aim of the project is to analyze the incident and predict the survival
rates of passengers if any such incidents happen in the near future. To pass this enormous
data through proper Big Data Analytics and Data Visualization algorithms and gain the
output in proper self-describing format is the main problem definition here. The problem
definition when solved will help both the parties involved, i.e. the customers as well as the
business owners.
***
*Problem Statement:*
The dataset consists of 1309 entries of 12 variables and can give valuable insights when properly analyzed. 
The dataset contains various columns like passenger ID,survival condition,name,age,sex,fare etc. 
Here the main aim is to obtain visual information about the reasons and analyze the titanic hazard. 
Based upon the analysis we can find out the survival chances of individuals.
